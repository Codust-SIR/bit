<Box sx={{marginLeft:9}}><Typography variant="h6" color="text.secondary" fontFamily="serif">The website of BIT collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (9) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.</Typography></Box>
<br/>
<Box sx={{marginLeft:9}}><Typography variant="h6" color="text.secondary" fontFamily="serif">When using these general data and information, the Controller does not draw any conclusions about the data subject.

Therefore, the Controller analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject</Typography></Box>
